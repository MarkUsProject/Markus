Thanks for using MarkUs!

NOTE: If you are a MarkUs developer, please follow setup instructions here:
  http://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/wiki

1. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

MarkUs is a Web application using the Ruby on Rails framework. By design, MarkUs
supports one course per installation. I.e. two different courses require two
installed instances of MarkUs. Please keep that in mind for the following
installation process.

2. DOWNLOAD MARKUS

You can download MarkUs from our website
see http://www.markusproject.org/download/

3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

3.1 REQUIRED SOFTWARE

  As mentioned previously, MarkUs is a Ruby on Rails application. General
  requirements are as follows (Note: MarkUs also works using Phusion Passenger):

    * Ruby (version 1.8.7 and higher)
    * Ruby development package (required for compiling Ruby PostgreSQL drivers)
    * net/https Ruby library (libopenssl-ruby Debian package)
    * RDoc (required for Gem)
    * Debian 'build-essential' equivalent packages (gcc, make, libc6-dev, etc.)
      These packages are required for building PostgreSQL/MySQL gem packages
    * Subversion including Ruby bindings
    * Gem (version 1.3 and higher)
    * The following Ruby gems:
        - rails (version 2.3.8)
        - daemons (version 1.0.10 and higher)
        - mongrel (version 1.1.5 and higher)
        - mongrel_cluster (version 1.0.5 and higher)
        - fastercsv (version 1.4.0 and higher)
        - rake (version 0.8.7 and higher)
	- ruby-debug (in case you want to debug MarkUs)
	- will_paginate (version 2.3.11 and higher)
        - rubyzip (version 0.9.4 and higher)
        - ya2yaml (version 0.29.2 and higher)
    * Apache httpd (version 2.2 and higher) including the following modules:
        - mod_proxy
        - mod_rewrite
        - mod_dav_svn (required if you want to allow SVN repository access)
        - mod_authz_svn (required if you want to allow SVN repository access)
    * ImageMagick (known to work with >=6.5.7, older versions should be ok too)
      Only required if you plan to be able to view and annotate pdfs within
      the browser (PDF_SUPPORT setting in config files) 

  DATABASE

  We know that MarkUs works with either PostgreSQL or MySQL databases.

    MarkUs/PostgreSQL:
    If you plan to use MarkUs with a PostgreSQL database, you need the following
    software

      * PostgreSQL
      * Development package(s) for PostgreSQL
      * Ruby gems:
          - ruby-pg (version 0.7.9.2008.01.28 and higher)
          - postgres (version 0.7.9.2008.01.28 and higher)

    MarkUs/MySQL:
    If you plan to use MarkUs with a MySQL database, you need the following
    software

      * MySQL
      * Development package(s) for MySQL
      * Ruby gems:
          - mysql (version 2.8.1 and higher)

  If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu) you could
  install the above required software by using commands similar to the
  following:

  PostgreSQL option:

    sudo aptitude install ruby ruby-dev rdoc libopenssl-ruby postgresql \
    libpq-dev subversion libsvn-ruby apache2 libapache2-svn

  MySQL option:

    sudo aptitude install ruby ruby-dev rdoc mysql-server libmysqlclient15-dev \
    subversion libsvn-ruby libopenssl-ruby apache2 libapache2-svn

  Installing gem (version 1.3 and higher) on Debian based systems (see
    http://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/wiki/RailsDebianUpdate)

      Download rubygems from rubyforge.org (see
      http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/); We show the steps for version
      1.3.7:
	wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/70696/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
        tar -xzf rubygems-1.3.7.tgz
        cd rubygems-1.3.7
        sudo ruby setup.rb
        sudo mv /usr/bin/gem /usr/bin/gem.old # if you have an older gem version
                                                installed
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem

  The above required Ruby gems can, then, be installed like so:

    PostgreSQL option:
      sudo gem install rails daemons mongrel mongrel_cluster ruby-pg postgres
      fastercsv rake ruby-debug will_paginate
    MySQL option:
      sudo gem install rails daemons mongrel mongrel_cluster mysql
      fastercsv rake ruby-debug will_paginate

  ImageMagick:

  You most likely already have this installed, to make sure you do, simply run
  `identify --version` to see if ImageMagick is installed on your machine.

  Otherwise, http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php#unix
  has detailed instructions on installing ImageMagick.

3.2 INSTALLING MARKUS

  Once you have the required software installed, it should be pretty straight-
  forward to install MarkUs. We assume you have a database user with appropriate
  permissions set up.

  * Get a copy of the MarkUs tarball:
      wget http://www.markusproject.org/download/markus-latest-stable.tar.gz
  * Extract the tarball to the desired location
      tar -xzvf markus-latest-stable.tar.gz
  * You should have a directory called markus-X.Y.Z now. Change to MarkUs'
    application root. For example:
      cd markus-0.9.0
  * Set environment variable RAILS_ENV (assumes BASH)
      export RAILS_ENV="production"
  * In case you are using Rails > 2.3.8 comment out the line containing
    RAILS_GEM_VERSION="2.3.8" in config/environment.rb
  * Configure database connection settings to match your settings
      PostgreSQL option:
        cp config/database.yml.postgresql config/database.yml
      MySQL option:
        cp config/database.yml.mysql config/database.yml
  * Configure MarkUs to match your requirements. Please have a look at
    config/environments/production.rb. This file is well documented and
    your instance specific configuration has to be done in there. If you
    have questions, please feel free to get in touch with us:
    markus-users@cs.toronto.edu
  * Create the database for MarkUs
      rake db:create
  * Load the database schema for MarkUs
      rake db:schema:load
  * Create an instructor (for initial login)
      rake markus:instructor first_name="test" last_name="test" \
      user_name="markus"
  * Configure Apache httpd (optional, see example config below)
  * Configure Mongrel servers (config/mongrel_cluster.yml)
  * Once MarkUs boots up fine (script/server runs without errors), you can start
    the mongrel cluster
      mongrel_rails cluster::start
    see log files (log/mongrel.800x.log) for success/failure messages
  * That's it!

If you run into any problems please send e-mail to markus-users@cs.toronto.edu.
We are happy to help and would also like to hear your feedback! Please include
the version number of MarkUs you are using. You can find out about the version
you are currently using by issuing the following command:
  rake -s markus:version
