If Accept no late submissions is selected then students will be warned that their submission will not be graded if they attempt to submit after the deadline.  You may choose to give students some number of Grace credits in the Users view, and you can choose the grace period times here.  The Penalty Decay formula allows you to deduct X marks for every Y time period.  The Penalty Formula allows you to specify both the value of the penalty and the time period.

This associates each group with the version of their files that should be graded. This means that when the grader adds annotations and marks, they belong to this particular submission. There are three different ways of collecting submissions: Collect All Submissions, which automatically collects all submissions, based on the due date and late penalties; clicking on an individual group name triggers automatic collection for that group; clicking on the Repository name takes you the Repository view, where you can manually choose a revision to collect.<br>Rows in green have been collected and are ready to begin marking. Clicking on the group name takes you to the Grader view. When a grader sets the Marking State to Complete and you are ready to allow students to view the results, select the students and press \"Release Marks\".<br>CSV Report and Detailed CSV Report are two different ways of downloading the marks in csv format. Subversion Repo List downloads a text file that maps group name to repository path. Subversion Export File downloads a text file where each line is an svn export command for the collected version of each student submission. Download all submissions downloads a zip file containing repositories for all of the students."
