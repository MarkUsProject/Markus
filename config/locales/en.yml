This associates each group with the version of their files that should be graded. This means that when the grader adds annotations and marks, they belong to this particular submission.

Clicking on the group name takes you to the Grader view. When a grader sets the Marking State to Complete and you are ready to allow students to view the results, select the students and press \"Release Marks\".<br>CSV Report and Detailed CSV Report are two different ways of downloading the marks in csv format. Subversion Repo List downloads a text file that maps group name to repository path.
