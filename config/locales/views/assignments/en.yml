        assignment_type_html: "Persist Groups/Properties from ___: use the same groups and repositories from previous assignment. If selected, assignment folders will be created for every group immediately, rather than when a student clicks on the assignment for the first time.<br />If students can form their own groups, group names are always autogenerated. You can also create groups manually or by uploading a file."

Used to determine which version of a student's submission to grade. Can be changed later (e.g., for extensions).

        remark_request_rules: "If remark requests are allowed, students will see a form they can fill in to request a remark after the marks have been released. Submitted remark requests are visible in the Submissions view. When responding to a remark request, you will see the original marks and your modifications. You will be able to add new annotations and comments. When you release the remark results, the students will see the updated marks and comments."

If Accept no late submissions is selected then students will be warned that their submission will not be graded if they attempt to submit after the deadline.  You may choose to give students some number of Grace credits in the Users view, and you can choose the grace period times here.  The Penalty Decay formula allows you to deduct X marks for every Y time period.  The Penalty Formula allows you to specify both the value of the penalty and the time period. If students are working in a group, grace credits will be deducted from every group member."
