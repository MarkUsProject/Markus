      </p> <h3>Editing Exam Templates</h3> <p>
        Select an Exam Template on the left to edit it. In addition to changing the name and template file you may also
        make changes to the following:
      </p> <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>%{template_division_title}</h4>
          <p>
            A template division specifies a mapping of test page number to question (e.g., Question 1 appears on
            page 2, and Question 2 appears on pages 2-3). When processing scanned test papers, MarkUs will groups
            pages by template divisions. The first page is assumed to be a cover page and therefore cannot be included
            into a template division. Any additional pages that are not included in any template divisions will be
            grouped into a special file called "EXTRA.pdf".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>%{automatic_parsing_title}</h4>
          <p>
            If enabled, MarkUs will attempt to scan a portion of the test cover page and parse handwriting corresponding
            to either a student's user name or ID number. MarkUs will then attempt to match the test paper to a student
            in the course. This feature is not designed to replace the manual matching process. For more details please
            consult the <a href=https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/blob/%{markus_version}/Instructor-Guide--Scanned-Exams.md#automatic-parsing-of-student-information>wiki</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul> <h3>Uploading Completed Test Papers</h3> <p>
        Select "Upload Scans" on the left. After selecting an Exam Template, you can then upload a pdf of the completed
        test papers. MarkUs will then use the selected Exam Template as a reference to split and format the pdf into
        individual submissions. Any errors with the upload process will be displayed in the Uploaded Scans Log.
      </p> <h3>Finalizing Submissions</h3> <p>
        After you have ensured all scanned files have been uploaded and all QR code parsing errors have been fixed,
        you must collect submissions in order to begin grading. To do this, go to the "Submissions" tab and select all
        rows. Finally, press "Collect Submissions". Grading can then begin as normal.
      </p> <h3>Matching test papers to students</h3> <p>
        After submissions have been finalized, to match test papers to students, click on the "Assign Scans" link on
        the left. Alternatively, navigate to the "groups" tab of this assignment. Click on the "Assign Scans" link
        beside the first group and begin matching each test paper to a student.
