      automatic_parsing_help_html: If enabled, MarkUs will attempt to scan a portion of the test cover page and parse handwriting corresponding to either a student's user name or ID number. MarkUs will then attempt to match the test paper to a student in the course. This feature is not designed to replace the manual matching process. For more details please consult the <a href=https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/blob/%{markus_version}/Instructor-Guide--Scanned-Exams.md#automatic-parsing-of-student-information>wiki</a>

      finalize_submissions_message: After you have ensured all scanned files have been uploaded and all QR code parsing errors have been fixed, you must collect submissions in order to begin grading.

Grading can then begin as normal.

When processing scanned test papers, MarkUs will groups pages by template divisions. Any pages that are not included in any template divisions will be grouped into a special file called "EXTRA.pdf".
