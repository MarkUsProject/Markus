Welcome to MarkUs! Online Marking Made Easy
===========================================

MarkUs is a web application for the submission and grading of student assignments. The primary purpose of MarkUs is to provide TAs with simple tools that will help them to give high quality feedback to students. MarkUs also provides a straight-forward interface for students to submit their work, form groups, and receive feedback. The administrative interface allows instructors to manage groups, organize the grading, and release grades to students.

MarkUs is written using Ruby on Rails, and uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) to store the student submissions.

## 4. Credits

MarkUs grew out of OLM, which was built using the TurboGears framework. We are
grateful to everyone who worked on or funded both projects, and to the creators
of Ruby on Rails for building such a great framework.

MarkUs' development has been supported by the University of Toronto, École
Centrale de Nantes, et. al. Kudos to everyone who turned that support into
working code, which you can see in our [Contributors list](doc/markus-contributors.txt)
