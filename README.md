Welcome to MarkUs! Online Marking Made Easy
===========================================

MarkUs is a Ruby on Rails and React web application for the submission and grading of student assignments. The primary purpose of MarkUs is to provide TAs with simple tools that will help them to give high quality feedback to students. MarkUs also provides a straight-forward interface for students to submit their work, form groups, and receive feedback. The administrative interface allows instructors to manage groups, organize the grading, and release grades to students.

## 1. Features

- Student files are stored using [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Students submit files through the web interface or using version control
- Graders can easily annotate students' code
- Instructors can form groups or students can form groups on their own
- Web-based course administration
- See the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki) for more features

## 4. Credits

MarkUs grew out of OLM, which was built using the TurboGears framework. We are
grateful to everyone who worked on or funded both projects, and to the creators
of Ruby on Rails for building such a great framework.
Since 2008, more than 140 undergraduate students have participated in the development of MarkUs; some as full-time summer interns, but most working part time on MarkUs as a project course or on a volunteer basis.

MarkUs' development has been supported by the University of Toronto, École
Centrale de Nantes, et. al. Kudos to everyone who turned that support into
working code, which you can see in our [Contributors list](doc/markus-contributors.txt)
