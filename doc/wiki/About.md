## About MarkUs

MarkUs is a web application for the submission and grading of student programming assignments. The primary purpose of MarkUs is to provide TAs with simple tools that will help them to give high quality feedback to students. MarkUs also provides a straight-forward interface for students to submit their work, form groups, and receive feedback. The administrative interface allows instructors to manage groups, organize the grading, and release grades to students.

Since 2008, more than 120 undergraduate students have participated in the development of MarkUs; some as full-time summer interns, but most working part time on MarkUs as a project course. The fact that we have have uncovered so few major bugs, and that MarkUs has been so well-received by instructors is a testament to the high quality work of these students. MarkUs is used in more than a dozen courses at the University of Toronto, in several courses at the University of Waterloo, and at Ã‰cole Centrale Nantes (in French).

MarkUs is written using Ruby on Rails, and supports both Git and Subversion to store the student submissions.
