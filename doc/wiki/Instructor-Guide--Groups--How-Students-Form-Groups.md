# How Students Form Groups

This mini-page briefly goes through the steps for a student to create a group for an assignment:

After navigating to the appropriate assignment, students will need to have **one** member of their group click the `Create Group` button to create their group:

Once this is done, the inviter will have to invite each member of their team to the group:

If a student is not eligible to be a part of their group they will receive a warning:
![Could not invite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50387112/65207829-11fd3300-da61-11e9-91bf-bb9ababa3bed.png)

Once the inviter has invited someone, they will appear under the inviter's "Your Group" but will have a pending status until accepted by the invited:
![Join Group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50387112/65207993-b1222a80-da61-11e9-891e-8430e37643cf.png)

Once the student's group meets the minimum member requirements for the assignment, they will be allowed to submit files for the assignment.

> :warning: **WARNING** When adding other students to their group, the inviter must type in their teammate's exact username (case sensitive) and not just their first/last name.
