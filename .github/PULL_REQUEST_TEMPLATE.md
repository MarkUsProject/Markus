## Proposed Changes
*(Describe your changes here. Also describe the motivation for your changes: what problem do they solve, or how do they improve the application or codebase? If this pull request fixes an open issue, [use a keyword to link this pull request to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).)*

Adds tests for the ‚Äúmarks released‚Äù edge-case to both `#new` (GET) and `#create` (POST). Each spec builds an assignment with released results, makes the corresponding request (`get_as` or `post_as`), and verifies that the controller flashes the correct error and returns `400 Bad Request`.

## Questions and Comments
*(Include any questions or comments you have regarding your changes.)*\
I split each controller action into two scenarios:
1. Marks not released ‚Äì existing examples remain here.
2. Marks released ‚Äì new examples that test the error-path.
Github tests all pass for now.
