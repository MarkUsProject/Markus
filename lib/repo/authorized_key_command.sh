# This function replaces '(instance)' with a * glob pattern and then appends '.authorized_keys'.
# This allows this script to find all .authorized_keys files associated
# with all MarkUs instances.
#
# For example:
#  echo $(authorized_key_paths)  # /some/path/*/repos/.authorized_keys
authorized_key_paths() {
  echo "${MARKUS_REPO_LOC_PATTERN//(instance)/*}/.authorized_keys"
}

# shellcheck disable=SC2046
