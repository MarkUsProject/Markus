Story Description
================================================================================

When all submissions are in marking-status "marked" the instructor can release
marks, so that students can view marks for their submissions. Also, he/she can
unrelease marks. Once marks have been released, they cannot be changed. In
order to change marks upon release the instructor has to unrelease marks
first.
