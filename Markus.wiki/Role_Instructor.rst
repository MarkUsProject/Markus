Role Description: Instructor
================================================================================

The instructor teaches a CS course and overlooks students' and TAs'
activities. He/She is a regular user of the software. I.e. once the instructor
is familiar with the software, it should be very easy for him/her to recall
this knowledge. The application supports the instructor in marking course-work
- usually conveyed by TAs -  and grading the course which he/she teaches. In
contrast to Students (only view privileges) and TAs (restricted write
privileges), an instructor has unrestricted privileges (Superuser).

*Note:* It is particular important that an instructor can easily transfer
configuration settings and data from one course to another (new) course.
