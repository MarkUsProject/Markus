Role Description: Student
================================================================================

The typical student using the software is in his/her first or second year. The
student will be using MarkUs for submitting assignments, viewing marks,
forming groups. Initially, the student is not familiar with MarkUs and the
process it supports. However, he/she will be using the software on a regular
basis for submitting assignments and other course-work. Although the student
is typically very computer-savvy, the software should be very easy to use
since the student has to hand-in his/her assigned course-work by using the
software.
