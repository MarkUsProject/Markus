Story Description
================================================================================

When reading the source code of a submission-file, the Grader can add
annotations to any line of code. When a new comment is created the Grader adds
a description of the concern/problem only. The title of the comment will be
generated from the description (i.e. use first n characters for title).

*Note:* Provide comments with timestamps internally

Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add several annotations to a file and check if the saved annotations conform
with the line number of the source code file.  * Remove annotations * Edit
annotation and move to another page without saving the modifications (show
warning in that case)
