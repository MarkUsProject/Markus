These are my notes from the feedback we had

* In general

  * Keep it simple:  The less links the pages displayes, the less people will
    search through them. Example of google, which is a search engine. Almost
    all the links displayed on the page concern the search engin

	* Be precise and clear: in the names, for example...

	* Observe the feedback data: no one clics on a certain link. Why? 

	* Have a look at other design. Good ideas can be taken from other website

* For Markus

	* In the admin interface, student list:

		* Change CVS into CSV file

	* In the student interface, assignment's summary

		* There is a double "Create group", one as a title, one as a link

    * Some of the things are redondant with the manage group view. Maybe merge
      them? Or is unecessary?

		* The inviter is displayed in red. Keep red for problems!

    * Maybe the due date shouldn't be displayed in this format... Maybe the
      number of days left befor this due date?

	* In the student interface, group's formation

		* Student not ordered in a logical order. Legal problem?

    * Multiselect box, in the list of student, to choose them, rather than the
      actuel system of select

		* Inviter's name is in red. Same pbm as in the assignment's summary view

	* In the student interface, Submissions view

    * There is a warning box, when the student hasn't upload the required
      files yet. This information shouldn't be displayed like this : it gives
      the impression the student did something wrong, which is not the case.
