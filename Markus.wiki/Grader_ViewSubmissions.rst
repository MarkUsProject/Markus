Story Description
================================================================================

Graders can click on a submission, which has been assigned to him/her by the
course instructor. When selecting a submission by clicking on it the Grader
should be provided a view which enables him/her to mark this particular
assignment. The submission should be read only, but the Grader should be able
to add comments/annotations required for marking.

Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Test that submissions, which are not assigned to the current Grader-user,
are read-only (i.e. the Grader should not be allowed to add
annotations/comments to submissions assigned to other Graders)
