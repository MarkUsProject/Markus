Role Description: Grader
================================================================================

The Grader is usually familiar with the software and uses it primarily for
grading course-work handed in by students, which has been assigned to him/her
by the instructor. Although he/she uses the software regularly, it
occasionally occurs that some months separate active use of the application
(e.g. summer break). The Grader is computer-savvy, but what he/she learns when
using the software must be easily recalled months later.
