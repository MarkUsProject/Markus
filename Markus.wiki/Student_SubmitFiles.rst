Story Description
================================================================================

Students - already members of a group - can submit files for an submission. All
members of a "submission-group" can add new files, replace existing files and
delete files. 

Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use different student logins to test if files are modifiable.

* Show that student who formerly participated in another group (for a previous
  assignment) can only modify files of the current group in which she
  participates in.
