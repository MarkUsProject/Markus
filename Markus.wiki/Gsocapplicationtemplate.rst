MarkUs GSoC Application Template
================================

Please answer the following questions for your MarkUs GSoC project application. It will help us getting a better understanding of what your experience with certain technologies and tools is. Certain ideas will require more skills than others. Don't be discouraged if you don't have experience with all technologies mentioned in questions below.

  1. Have you used Git before? If yes, for how long have you used it? On a scale from 1 to 10 rate your familiarity with Git (10 = I'm the maintainer of Git; 1 = Git? What's that?)
  2. Do you have some Web application programming experience? If yes, what technology did you use? Have you done Rails development before?
  3. Are you familiar with Linux? Have you used it as a development platform before? Do you have Linux administration/debugging experience?
  4. Rate your Subversion skills (1 = Subversion? what's that?; 5 = I'm comfortable using it; 10 = I have written most the Subversion code)
  5. Do you know how to profile Ruby code? If you have any experience, explain what you've done.
  6. If you were to develop something involving Apache Ant, Ruby, virtual machines, SSH, and Linux how would that make you feel? Rating: 1 = Sounds like a little too much for my taste. 5 = I'm intrigued. Might be able to pull that off. 10 = I'm excited, when can I start. I've pretty much used all of it before.
  7. What do you like most about open source projects? What would make you stay as a MarkUs contributor after doing GSoc?
