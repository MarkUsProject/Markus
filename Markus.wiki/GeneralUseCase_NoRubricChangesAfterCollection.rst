Story Description
================================================================================

Once submissions have been assigned to TAs and TAs started marking submission
using particular rubrics for that submission, those rubrics should not be
allowed to be changed by the instructor. Maybe OLM should warn the instructor
that submissions have been already marked using old rubrics.

I can see this being a problem if, during the marking of the assignments, a
trend appears that results in the need to change the rubric.

For example, say there is an assignment, where part of that assignment is to
include a README.txt of the code that is handed in. Say the rubric is set up
so that the README.txt is worth 25% of the final grade for this assignment.

What if, during marking, the TAs and instructors realize that they had failed
to mention the README.txt in the handout. Hey - instructors are human too, and
make mistakes.

Possible solution: while rubric criteria can't be added or removed, their
weights can be adjusted. So, that README.TXT criterion could have its weight
set to 0, making it worth nothing. We could even tell OLM to hide any rubric
criteria with weights set to 0...

Anyhow, just an idea.
