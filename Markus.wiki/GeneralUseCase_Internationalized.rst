General Use CaseÂ : Internationalized
================================================================================

Every user should be able to choose the language he wants. We added a list in the
toolbar once the user is logged in to change the language of the application.
Today, MarkUs is fully translated (localization and internationalization) in
French (and English, which was the original language).

*Note:* See [[Internationalization | Internationalization]] to see development
aspect of Internationalization.
