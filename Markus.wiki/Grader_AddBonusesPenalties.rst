Story Description
================================================================================

If the instructor permits it, the Grader can add bonuses (extra marks) or
penalties (deductions) to a submission. Bonuses and penalties show up in the
submission detail/summary view and of course change overall marks for a
submission.

Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Test if added bonuses increase marks for the submission appropriately
(similarly, if penalties decrease marks of a submission)

Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Is it possible that a submission-group gets a bonus **and** a penalty for a
submission?
