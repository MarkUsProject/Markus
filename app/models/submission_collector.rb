# A signleton class responsible for collecting submissions from groupings.
#
# The SubmissionCollector keeps track of groupings it needs to collect
# submissions from via two queues, one regular queue to keep track of groupings
# whose submissions need to be collected. The second queue is the priority
# queue, whose members' submissions get collected ahead of the ones in the
# regular queue.
#
# The actual creation of the submissions for the grouping is done inside a
# forked process due to the length of time taken to collect submissions with
# pdf files in them.
#
# The collector updates the groupings to let them know if they are in queue for
# collection, in order to figure out if their current submission is the latest
# one, or theres a newer one waiting to be collected.
#
# Both queues are stored in the database to allow for easy parent-child
# process communication bypassing the need for pipes or signals.
