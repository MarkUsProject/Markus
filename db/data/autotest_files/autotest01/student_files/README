Student names describe a test scenario

Names that contain _2s_ indicate that there are two test scripts used in this test and the results from each are
expected to be different

Names that contain _2t_ indicate that there are two tests in a single script and the results from each are expected
to be different

Names that contain _2s_ or _2t_ will end in either 1 or 2. This digit indicates whether there is an expected error
in the 1st or 2nd test (whether in different scripts or not)

Names that end in A or B are part of a test scenario that requires two students. These tests are mostly used to
test the cleanup of files or processes on the test server. Files that end in A are run first and those that end
in B are run second.
