# ChunkyPNG uses and enforces standard.rb as code style (see https://github.com/testdouble/standard).
# For backwards compatilibity and idiosyncratic preferences of the main author,
# there are some minor differences listed in here.

ruby_version: 2.2

ignore:
- lib/chunky_png/**/*.rb:
  # We allow `for` loops in the codebase, especially in hot paths,
  # because they perform better than `each` blocks.
  - "Style/For"

- spec/chunky_png/**/*.rb:
  # In RSpec, having to follow this rule will cause expectations to
  # be less readable, specifically blocks for the `change` matcher.
